Cognito Hosted UI SSO for WordPress with optional user provisioning and Cognito user sync.

== Description ==

WP Cognito SSO provides:

* Cognito Hosted UI login redirect and callback handling.
* Automatic WordPress user provisioning from id_token claims.
* Configurable role mapping from Cognito claims to WordPress roles.
* Optional WordPress -> Cognito user sync via AWS SDK.

== Installation ==

1. Upload the plugin to `wp-content/plugins/wp-cognito-sso`.
2. If you installed from source, install dependencies:

```
cd wp-content/plugins/wp-cognito-sso
composer install --no-dev --optimize-autoloader
```

3. Activate the plugin through the WordPress Plugins screen.
4. Configure settings under Settings -> Cognito SSO.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Where is the callback endpoint? =

The callback endpoint is the configured redirect path (default: `/cognito-login`). The settings page shows the full callback URL.

= Do I need the AWS SDK? =

Only if you enable WordPress -> Cognito user sync. Hosted UI login works without the SDK.

= Does this plugin send users to Cognito automatically? =

Yes, if you enable "Auto redirect". Requests to wp-admin, wp-login.php, REST/AJAX, and excluded paths are not redirected.
